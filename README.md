# Iron-Man-Jarvis-AI-Desktop-Voice-Assistant
Problem Statement:
Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. This thought in my mind addressed me to build this project.
Description: 
In my project, I have used the concept of Python with Artificial Intelligence. I have imported the modules and make my desktop to take my commands and follow my instructions such as open youtube, google, Instagram, facebook, play music, search on Wikipedia, current time and send emails without typing. Itâ€™s really an interesting project to work on.
Tools & Technologies Used:
